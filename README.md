Rust wrap of lbfgsb algorithm

=======

(created lbfgsb library)

This is a simple rust wrapper of C version of L-BFGS-B algorithm by Stephen Becker, which can efficiently handle large-scale optimization problems with simple bounds on the variables.

Usage: see tests/driver1.rs for details.

It's a slightly modified version of original library https://github.com/ybyygu/rust-lbfgsb, that compiles
